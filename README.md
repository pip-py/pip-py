## Hey ðŸ‘‹

Hi I'm Joe and I am currently the Lead Data Scientist for Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and I am studying for my MRes in Advanced Artificial Inteliggence [24->26]. 


Within this github I am working on two open-source projects;
* **SupaQ** -> is a very efficient Discrete Event Simulation(DES) for the simplest of networks, designed for use in wait time scenario modelling
  * If you're an expert in building libraries and functionality this may be the perfect place for you to take some shonky data-scientists code and transform it into a highly versatile tool!
* **Public Sector Drive Times** -> with the use of Ordnance Survey drive time data and openstreetmaps - create an efficient tool for analysis locations **locally** and for **free** (if you have the public sector geospatial agreement)
  * if not public sector! well the functionality can be built off the back of any edge speed data that you have!
  * This is **not** a library but a series of notebooks built off of the backs of the amazing NetworkX and OSMNX libraries
