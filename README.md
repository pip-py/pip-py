## Hey 👋

Hi I'm Joe and I am currently working as a Data Scientist for Sciensus.


Within this github I am working on open-source projects;

### OS Projects/Published Work

* [**SimuWait**](https://github.com/SimuWait/SimuWait) -> is a very efficient Discrete Event Simulation(DES) for the simplest of networks, designed for use in wait time scenario modelling
  * This is currently in private mode
* [**Public Sector Drive Times**](https://github.com/pip-py/public_sector_drive_time) -> with the use of Ordnance Survey drive time data and openstreetmaps - create an efficient tool for analysis locations **locally** and for **free** (if you have the public sector geospatial agreement)
  * if not public sector! well the functionality can be built off the back of any edge speed data that you have! OR through the paid options of ONS data!
  * This is **not** a library but a series of notebooks built off of the backs of the amazing NetworkX and OSMNX libraries
 
### MRes Assignments and Projects;
* [**Invariance in Variational Auto-Encoders: Evaluation of Latent Representation for
Image Classification**](https://github.com/pip-py/mres_inv_vae) -> Formative Assignment (ungraded ~ indicative mark 69%) Advanced Methods in Machine Learning - Course Lead Dr.Ivor Simpson
* [**In Plane Sight: Scanline Encoders for SNN's**](https://github.com/pip-py/mres_ips_scanline_snn) -> Summative Assignment (self directed research ~ 71%) Advanced Methods in Bio-Inspired AI - Course Lead Dr.Thomas Nowotny
* [**SimVPv2 for Image Sequence Interpolation and Extrapolation**](https://github.com/pip-py/mres_image_sequence_learning) -> Summative Assignment (defined problem ~ 67%) Advanced Methods in Machine Learning - Course Lead Dr.Ivor Simpson

[Note: NLP unit not listed here, formative (graded): 79/100) 


Research interest;
* Democratisation of AI & ML
* Open-source scalable software solution for public good
* Trust and Safety AI & ML
* AI & ML for Health
* Computer Vision
