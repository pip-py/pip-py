## Hey ðŸ‘‹

Hi I'm Joe and I am currently the Lead Data Scientist for Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and I am studying for my MRes in Advanced Artificial Intelligence [24->26]. 


Within this github I am working on two open-source projects;

### OS Projects/Published Work

[**note** - first drafts of the two below projects are due to go-live late December :)] 

* [**SupaQ**](https://github.com/pip-py/SupaQ) -> is a very efficient Discrete Event Simulation(DES) for the simplest of networks, designed for use in wait time scenario modelling
  * If you're an expert in building libraries and functionality this may be the perfect place for you to take some shonky data-scientists code and transform it into a highly versatile tool!
* [**Public Sector Drive Times**](https://github.com/pip-py/public_sector_drive_time) -> with the use of Ordnance Survey drive time data and openstreetmaps - create an efficient tool for analysis locations **locally** and for **free** (if you have the public sector geospatial agreement)
  * if not public sector! well the functionality can be built off the back of any edge speed data that you have! OR through the paid options of ONS data!
  * This is **not** a library but a series of notebooks built off of the backs of the amazing NetworkX and OSMNX libraries
 
### MRes Assignments and Projects;
* [**Invariance in Variational Auto-Encoders: Evaluation of Latent Representation for
Image Classification**](https://github.com/pip-py/mres_inv_vae) -> Formative Assignment (ungraded) Advanced Method in Machine Learning 

Research interest;
* Democratisation of AI & ML
* Open-source scalable software solution for public good
* Trust and Safety AI & ML
* Computer Vision
